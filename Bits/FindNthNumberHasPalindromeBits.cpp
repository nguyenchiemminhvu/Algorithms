Find the nth number whose binary representation is a palindrome. Do not consider the leading zeros, while considering the binary representation. Consider the 1st number whose binary representation is palindrome as 1, instead of 0

Examples:

Input : 1
Output : 1
1st Number whose binary representation 
is palindrome is 1 (1)

Input : 9
Output : 27
9th Number whose binary representation
is palindrome is 27 (11011)
