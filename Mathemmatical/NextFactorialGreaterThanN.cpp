Given a number N (â‰¤ 1018), the task is to find the next factorial number greater than N.

Examples:

Input: N = 24
Output: 120
Explanation:
As 4! = 24. So the next number which factorial and greater than 24 is 5!, which is 120

Input: N = 150
Output: 720
Explanation:
As 5! = 120. So the next number which factorial and greater than 150 is 6!, which is 720.
