You are given a string of 2N characters consisting of N ‘[‘ brackets and N ‘]’ brackets. A string is considered balanced if it can be represented in the for S2[S1] where S1 and S2 are balanced strings. We can make an unbalanced string balanced by swapping adjacent characters. Calculate the minimum number of swaps necessary to make a string balanced.

Examples:

Input  : []][][
Output : 2
First swap: Position 3 and 4
[][]][
Second swap: Position 5 and 6
[][][]

Input  : [[][]]
Output : 0
The string is already balanced.

We can solve this problem by using greedy strategies. If the first X characters form a balanced string, we can neglect these characters and continue on. If we encounter a ‘]’ before the required ‘[‘, then we must start swapping elements to balance the string.
