Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally,
one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time
(by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution that “works”.
Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have following property in common.
These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once. 
A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a configuration that follows given problem constraints.
Backtracking works in incremental way and is an optimization over the Naive solution where all possible configurations are generated and tried.
