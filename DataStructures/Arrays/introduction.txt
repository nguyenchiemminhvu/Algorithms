An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

Advantages of using arrays:

Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
Examples –

// A character array in C/C++/Java
char arr1[] = {'g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's'};

// An Integer array in C/C++/Java
int arr2[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

// Item at i'th index in array is typically accessed
// as "arr[i]".  For example arr1[0] gives us 'g'
// and arr2[3] gives us 40.
Usually, an array of characters is called a ‘string’, whereas an array of ints or floats is called simply an array.
